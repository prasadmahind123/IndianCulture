        "description": "Established in 1973, Jim Corbett National Park is a popular national park in India. Renowned for being the birthplace of Project Tiger and is the second-largest Tiger reserve in the country after Sunderbans. The park boasts a diverse landscape of rivers, hills, and grasslands, offering sightings of tigers, leopards, wild elephants, nilgai, and spotted deer. With its abundant flora and fauna, and the opportunity for overnight stays, it has become a favoured destination for tourists seeking nature's beauty.",

            "Jim Corbett Park simply known as the Corbett National Park is one of the most prestigious and famous forest reserves in India. Asia's oldest National Park, Jim Corbett National Park has remained an important one ever since its beginning. Before being recognized as one, the national park was a vast forest with unregulated activities occurring throughout the jungle. In the late 19th century, specifically in 1879, nearly 300 sq. km. of its jungles were marked off to be conserved. In 1907, during the British colonial rule in India, it was proposed that the area be made into a game reserve. In 1936, due to the efforts of Sir Malcolm Hailey and the environmentalist Jim Corbett, the park was declared a National Park, marking a historic moment as the first of its kind in Asia. Initially, it bore the name Hailey National Park.",
            "The park underwent a series of name changes, from Hailey National Park since its advent to Ramganga National Park in 1954. Which later, was renamed to be Jim Corbett National Park in 1955 to honor the contributions of the famous hunter-turned-naturalist, Jim Corbett, for his role in establishing the park and protecting its wildlife, particularly its tigers.",
            "It was later, in 1973, that Corbett Wildlife Reserve was declared a Tiger Reserve in line with the Project Tiger Initiative introduced by the government of India at the time. During that period, India had a total of 263 tigers, but today, Jim Corbett Tiger Reserve alone boasts of a population exceeding that number.",
            "Jim Corbett National Park is made up of hills, plateaus, grasslands, and is situated amidst the rough terrain of the Himalayas. These features all add to the park's rich biodiversity. The Ramganga River and the Ramganga Reservoir supply the park's inhabitants with sufficient water, apart from which the park is also home to numerous man-made and natural lakes. The whole area of the park includes the districts of Pauri Garhwal, Almora, and Nainital, and covers an area of 1,318 sq. km, with a core area of 520 sq. km and a buffer zone of 798 sq. km, that is made up of the Sonanadi wildlife sanctuary and the neighboring reserve forests. Sal trees, an essential resource for many species including tigers, elephants, and deer, are found in abundance in the national park's dense forests, with its grasslands also playing a significant role in the ecosystem, acting as both predators' hunting grounds and pasture grounds for herbivore animals."

Hence, it can be a little risky also. But the beauty will be at its peak with exotic greenery and amazing vegetation around.",

In day time, the weather becomes too hot and scorching that may go up to 40 degree c. So, in this time, the animals and other inhabitants of the park suffer from the extreme heat of sun.This season is called to be the best visiting season as it allows visitors to get the most of the animals inhabiting in the park.

The park's rich biodiversity also sustains significant populations of tigers, elephants, wild water buffaloes, swamp deer, and various bird species. Its landscapes encompass vast grasslands, marshes, and dense forests with towering elephant grass. Wildlife tourism includes a unique experience of an elephant safari, a rarity among national parks.",
        "info": [
            "All those who have thought Indian one-horned rhinoceros only existed in Jurassic-era, then a trip to Kaziranga is a must for them. One of the most sought after wildlife holiday destinations in India, Kaziranga National park’s 430 square kilometer area sprinkled with elephant-grass meadows, swampy lagoons, and dense forests is home to more than 2200 Indian one-horned rhinoceros, approximately 2/3rd of their total world population. Formed in 1908 on the recommendation of Mary Curzon, the park is located in the edge of the Eastern Himalayan biodiversity hotspots – Golaghat and Nagaon district. In the year 1985, the park was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It is said when Mary Curzon, the wife of the Viceroy of India – Lord Curzon of Kedleston, visited the park to see Indian one-horned rhinoceros; she wasn’t able to found even one. Then she persuaded her husband to take urgent measures to protect the dwindling species which he did by initiating planning for their protection. After a series of meetings and documentations, the Kaziranga Proposed Reserve Forest was created with an area of 232 km2 (90 sq mi) in 1905",
            "Along with the iconic Greater one-horned rhinoceros, the park is the breeding ground of elephants, wild water buffalo, and swamp deer. Over the time, the tiger population has also increased in Kaziranga, and that’s the reason why Kaziranga was declared as Tiger Reserve in 2006. Also, the park is recognized as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International for the conservation of avifaunal species. Birds like lesser white-fronted goose, ferruginous duck, Baer’s pochard duck and lesser adjutant, greater adjutant, black-necked stork, and Asian Openbill stork specially migrate from the Central Asia during the winter season.",
            "Undoubtedly, the park is known for its good population of animals but more than that its the wildlife conservation initiatives that take place in the park are more popular. With its amazing wildlife conservation activities, the park has successfully managed to grow the population of Greater one-horned rhinoceros, an endangered species.",
            "The vast expanse of tall elephant grass, marshland, and dense tropical moist broadleaf forests undoubtedly makes the park look beautiful but it’s the presence of Brahmaputra river, which makes it look enigmatic."

            "Winter" : "The winter season in Kaziranga extends from December to February, with cold yet enjoyable weather. The period from mid-December to mid-January is the coldest, and while it is not overly harsh, visitors sensitive to cold weather should bring warm woolen clothing and other essentials. Outside of this peak winter period, the cold remains manageable, allowing for an enjoyable visit without the need for extensive preparations.",
            "Monsoon" : "The monsoon season in Kaziranga National Park typically intensifies from June to September, characterized by heavy rainfall that leads to significant flooding, particularly from the Brahmaputra River. As a result, the park is closed during this period. The onset of monsoon in June brings substantial rainfall, with the region receiving an average of 2,220 mm (87 inches) by the end of September. This excessive rainfall often causes severe flooding, submerging approximately three-quarters of the park's western region. Consequently, this period is not ideal for visiting Kaziranga for wildlife holidays.",
            "Summer" : "March and April bring the spring season to Kaziranga, characterized by moderate weather. While the days may feel slightly warm, temperatures cool down as evening approaches. Tourism activity tends to increase during these months, as the pleasant weather requires less preparation and fewer items compared to the colder season. Many tourists consider November, February, and April the ideal months to visit Kaziranga, as they offer a balance between comfort and favorable conditions, avoiding the harsh cold. However, those who enjoy colder weather can still find delight in visiting Kaziranga during December and January."

However, the buffer zones from 6 to 10 remain operational between July and September, and as a result, tourist inflow in the national park is not paused. Although the crowd is comparatively light, the chances of wildlife sightings are also very low. Most parts of Ranthambore are filled with water and in case of heavy rainfall, safaris in the buffer zones are also halted.",
            "Summer" : "The summer season, from March to June, is generally less favored by visitors due to the intense heat. As Ranthambore Park is located near the Thar Desert, daytime temperatures can soar, often reaching up to 48°C. While the scorching sun makes it challenging for most people to explore the forest during this period, those who can endure the heat might consider visiting for two key reasons: first, the park is less crowded during the summer, and second, there is a greater likelihood of spotting the majestic tiger, particularly near the park's water bodies. However, it is essential to be well-prepared by bringing sunscreen, scarves, and lightweight, long-sleeved cotton clothing to protect yourself from the harsh sun. The early morning safaris that usually function from 7:00 am - 10:30 am are comparatively less challenging than the late afternoon safaris, 2:00 pm - 5:30 pm."

During this time, animals are active throughout the day, and the lush greenery enhances the park’s scenic beauty. It is also a peak tourist season, so expect larger crowds.",
            "Monsoon" : "Monsoon (July to September) brings heavy rainfall to Periyar, turning the park into a lush green paradise. With temperatures ranging between 20°C and 30°C, the rain enhances the beauty of the forest, making it perfect for nature lovers and photographers. However, wildlife sightings become more challenging as animals take shelter. Activities like boat safaris and trekking may also be affected by unpredictable rains, but this is the best time for those who enjoy solitude and the serene charm of the rainforest.",
            "Summer" : "Summer (March to June) is the best season for spotting wildlife, especially elephants and tigers. As the temperatures rise to 35°C, animals gather around water sources, making it easier to spot them during boat safaris and guided treks. However, the afternoons can be quite hot, so early morning and late evening safaris are the best options. Despite the heat, this season attracts wildlife enthusiasts due to the high chances of sightings."

            "Notably Maharashtra's oldest and largest National Park, 'the Tadoba National Park', also known as the 'Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve 'is one of India's 47 project tiger reserves existing in India. It lies in the Chandrapur district of Maharashtra state and is approximately 150 km from Nagpur city. The total area of the tiger reserve is 1,727 Sq.km, which includes the Tadoba National Park, created in the year 1955. The Andhari Wildlife Sanctuary was formed in the year 1986 and was amalgamated with the park in 1995 to establish the present Tadoba Andheri Tiger Reserve. The word 'Tadoba' is derived from the name of God Tadoba or Taru, which is praised by local tribal people of this region and 'Andhari' is derived from the name of Andhari river that flows in this area. ",
            "The Tadoba National Park is divided into three separate forest ranges, i.e. Tadoba north range, Kolsa south range, and Morhurli range, which is sandwiched in between the first two. There are two lakes and one river in the park, which gets filled every monsoon, the ‘Tadoba Lake,’ ‘Kolsa Lake,’ and ‘Tadoba River.’ These lakes and rivers provide vital ingredients needed to sustain the park’s life.",

Despite the heat, early morning and late afternoon safaris offer the highest chances of spotting tigers, leopards, and other wildlife. This season is ideal for serious wildlife enthusiasts who can handle the intense heat in exchange for incredible sightings."
