            "Jaisalmer Fort played a crucial role in Rajasthan’s trade and defense, as it was located on the ancient Silk Route, connecting India to Persia, Egypt, and Central Asia. Over the centuries, it withstood multiple invasions by Mughals, Delhi Sultans, and Rajput rulers. In 1299, the fort was attacked by Alauddin Khilji, leading to the legendary Jauhar (mass self-immolation) by Rajput women to avoid capture.",
            "In 1541, Mughal Emperor Humayun briefly occupied the fort, and later, the Bhati Rajputs allied with the Mughals to maintain control. After India’s independence, Jaisalmer lost its strategic importance but remained a major tourist and cultural landmark."
